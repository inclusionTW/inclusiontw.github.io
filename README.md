We are Inclusion, a team formed by students from National Taiwan University (NTU) initiating systematic and institutional plans of academic accommodations, which we would refer to as “inclusion plans”, for college students suffering from mental illnesses. 

Currently collaborating with the Youth Development Administration at the Ministry of Education in Taiwan, our team is reaching out to universities (including administrative staff, teaching staff, students, and etc.) around the world for possible online interviews concerning the policies they have implemented for students with mental health issues. 

For further background, there hasn’t been any standard operating procedure to provide in-campus documentation for students with mental illness in NTU until now. Students having trouble attending classes, meeting deadlines, or completing exams due to mental health problems find it awkward to inform instructors of their difficulties. The stigma of psychological disability haunts them, as they struggle for their conditions to be justified and hesitate to ask for help. Though the Student Counseling Center from the Office of Student Affairs at NTU does provide counseling sessions, it is not easily accessible due to scarcity of space and the insufficient amount of licensed counselors. Moreover, they do not provide documentation for academic accommodations, therefore reducing students’ bargaining power during negotiations with instructors. 

Owing to the lack of awareness for mental health on campus, especially among professors, some of our friends, even our team members, had undergone additional emotional distress during such discussions. Without the backing of an in-campus institution, students could only propose make-up measures with instructors individually, consequently enduring even more self-doubt and stress. 

These are the stories behind “Inclusion” -- We are advocating for institutional measures at NTU for the mentally-illed.

## 【Inclusion，讓課堂學習不只關乎知識傳授，更能成全每個學生獨一無二的樣子】

我們是一群來自社會學、法律學背景的研究生，在大學期間因故親身、或見證了身邊朋友，因為諸如憂鬱症等精神疾病、或尚未病理化的情緒困擾，交不出作業、沒有辦法出門上課、無法控制的缺考⋯⋯

和授課老師或助教「出櫃」是苦澀而酸楚的：

>「我不是學不會，但是我現在的狀況沒有辦法負擔這樣的課堂要求。」

>「我很怕跟老師說，我最近狀況不好所以不得已會遲交作業，是在要求特權或是會對其他同學不公平。」

>「我很想要學會這項技能、拿到學分，但是向助教求助，好像顯得是因為我比較弱、不擅長，但其實只要換個方式解釋給我聽、給我更多時間，就夠了。」

即使開口要求了，獲得的回應往往並不善意，甚至對於容易焦慮或自卑的學生來說，只會帶來更沈重的心理壓力，進而回過頭來影響課業表現。


有沒有可能，讓課堂設計、讓學習過程，回歸知識習得本身，並且發揮想像力，給予有不同需求的同學，不一樣的選擇和方案呢？

> 於是，2020 年 4 月，Inclusion 團隊成立了。

我們與教育部青年發展署 Young 飛全球行動計畫合作，連結各方經驗，除了實際與在地教師和學生的深度訪談，也針對英、美、澳、加等大學的心理健康相關法規、以及課程合理調整措施進行考察⋯⋯

我們相信，一個看得見精神疾病對於學習具體影響、透過心輔專業提供合理調整證明的制度，在臺灣是具體可行、能被落實而且真正幫助到同學的。

這是 Inclusion 的緣起，也是我們接觸各方關係人與推展各種行動方案時的初衷。
